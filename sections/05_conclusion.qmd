# Conclusion

During the campaign, we deployed 43 drifters of five different types and successfully modelled their trajectories using two independent approaches. Both methods reveal that drifter motion is governed by small-scale currents that remain poorly resolved in satellite observations. We demonstrate that these unresolved currents can be recovered along individual trajectories through an optimization procedure within the Linear Combination method. To establish a predictive framework, we implement the Maxey-Riley formulation, which accurately captures the observed dynamics in the majority of cases.

Additionally, we analyzed relative pair dispersion for drifter groups of identical type. Our results show an initial exponential growth phase transitioning to Richardson-regime scaling behavior, consistent with established theoretical predictions and previous observational studies. This work is ongoing, and further analysis will be conducted once the remaining drifter trajectories are recovered.
