# Conclusion

During the campaign, we deployed 43 drifters of five different types and successfully modelled their trajectories using two independent approaches. Performances of both methods reveal that drifter motion is governed by (i) small-scale currents that remain poorly resolved in satellite observations, (ii) direct wind forcing, whose impact remain hard to quantify in pratice.

Additionally, we analyzed relative pair dispersion for drifter groups of identical type. Our results show an initial exponential growth phase transitioning to Richardson-regime scaling behavior, consistent with established theoretical predictions and previous observational studies. This work is ongoing, and further analysis will be conducted once the remaining drifter trajectories are recovered.
