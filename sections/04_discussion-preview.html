<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spot-drifter-design">SPOT drifter design</h2>
<p>The SPOT drifters were an experimental design developed for the OTC25 campaign. They are highly cost-effective (approximately 300 € per unit, including one year of communication), easy to assemble, and capable of operating for several months at sea, even under rough conditions.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the SPOT drifters was their erratic GPS sampling frequency, which led to significant data gaps. We believe this issue was primarily caused by the Globalstar satellite network, which (i) does not allow messages to be relayed from one satellite to another before being transmitted to ground stations, (ii) does not retry transmission after a communication error, and (iii) has limited coverage at high latitudes –one SPOT drifter notably began transmitting only sporadically after crossing 70° N, despite emitting regularly at lower latitudes.</p>
<p>To improve the effective sampling frequency, future designs could consider increasing the nominal transmission rate—at the expense of battery life—or exploring alternative, albeit more expensive, satellite communication options. Another possible source of data gaps is the rotational motion observed around the drifters’ vertical axis. As attempted during the voyage, attaching a drogue directly to the surface float should be considered to help reduce this motion in rough sea conditions.</p>

<section id="linear-combination" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-combination">Linear combination</h3>
<p>By nature the linear combination model has a limited expressive power as it assumes that the drifter velocity is a weighted sum of only four components: the cylogeostrophic current, the Ekman current, the Stokes drift, and the leeway. We choose to parameterize and calibrate some of this terms but from the drifter GPS data, but assessing their estimated values is not trivial. Some of the drifter deployments during the campaign were filmed using drones, which could be used to validate or better estimate some estimated parameters, especially the windage coefficients. Additional terms could also be added to the model in order to account for other processes affecting the drifter motion, such as inertial oscillations <span class="citation" data-cites="sykulskiLagrangianTimeSeries2016">[@sykulskiLagrangianTimeSeries2016]</span> or tidal currents.</p>
<p>Drifter trajectories are not only affected by large-scale features, but also by small-scale eddies, fronts, or filaments, which are not yet resolved by satellite-derived current products. One way to account for these small-scale structures is to use stochastic representations of the drift and reconstruct ensembles of probable trajectories <span class="citation" data-cites="minguezStochasticLagrangianTrajectory2012 sykulskiLagrangianTimeSeries2016 brollyInferringOceanTransport2023">[@minguezStochasticLagrangianTrajectory2012; @sykulskiLagrangianTimeSeries2016; @brollyInferringOceanTransport2023]</span>. However, it is not clear how to calibrate such stochastic models, especially as the unresolved small-scale features are not homogeneous in space and time. Recent developments in machine learning could be leverage to learn a map from satellite observations capturing small-scale structures (such as sea surface temperature, ocean color, or surface roughness) to physical parameters (including in a stochastic setting) from drifter observations <span class="citation" data-cites="thoreyOnlineLearningContinuous2017 chengMachineLearningData2023">[@thoreyOnlineLearningContinuous2017; @chengMachineLearningData2023]</span>.</p>
<p>We presented here only three drifter trajectory reconstructions, but a more comprehensive evaluation of the model performance could be conducted using all drifters deployed during the campaign, including the OMB and CLS drifters.</p>

<section id="maxey-riley-framework" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maxey-riley-framework">Maxey-Riley framework</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the Maxey-Riley framework has been used only once to describe the dynamics of floating particles in the ocean <span class="citation" data-cites="olascoaga2020observation">[@olascoaga2020observation]</span>. Yet it is the theory derived from first principles that accounts for the forces excerted on a floating particle at the interface between a fluid and air. Unlike most theories that describe particle motion in the ocean, this model does not have fitting parameters. One typical fitting paramete in studies on search and rescue <span class="citation" data-cites="breivik2008operational">[@breivik2008operational]</span> is the leeway coefficient, that accounts for windage effects. In the framework of <strong>?@eq-MR</strong>, the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are calculated based on the particle geometry and the properties of the objects and the fields (density, viscosity).</p>
<p>Passing from the full Maxey-Riley equations (<strong>?@eq-MR-explicit</strong>) to the slow manifold approximation (<strong>?@eq-MR</strong>) facilitates numerical resolution since we passed from a second order differential equation (that is, two ordinary differential equaitons with two initial conditions) to a first order differential equation. We only need the initial position of the drifter but not its initial velocity. Taking a look at <strong>?@fig-MR-mediterranean</strong> we could think that the slow manifold approximation may have been an overstatement. However, the only assumption there is that the drifter size is smaller than the caracteristic lengths present in the system, which remains true. Let us review which assumptions we made may modify significantly the behavior of the numerical simulations.</p>
<p>First, we can wonder if the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, equivalent to a leeway coefficient, is well determined, since the wind seems to have an important effect on the obtained trajectories. We obtained a value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1 \%\)</span>, slightly smaller than the typical <span class="math inline">\(3 \%\)</span> commonly used as a leeway coeficient. We thus conclude that the mismatch between the trajectories must come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>MELODI drifters are not spheres, but are not perfect cylinders either. The correction <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> (<strong>?@eq-kappa</strong>) that accounts for the deviation from a sphere is not exactly well calculated because it is not straightforward to determine the radii of the equivalent sphere taking into account the metallic anchor included in the MELODI drifters. This discrepancy could be a source of error, because we are not only obtaining <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> from these values but also the density of the drifters. When more data from other drifters becomes available, we will compare our results to drifters with different geometries.</p>
<p>Another possible source of error is the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data. To accurately compute a numerical resolution of <strong>?@eq-MR</strong>, we need a short temporal step (for example, one minute). But the sattelite data is not available in such short periods and it is thus interpolated. A similar mechanism occurs with the spatial data. Satellites do not retrieve information on the small scales that affect the drifter movement. The Maxey-Riley framework assumes that we know the fields in the scales we need them but this is not the case. We think this is the biggest source of discrepancy between the real trajectories and the simulated ones. Nevertheless, the Maxey-Riley set provides a remarkably accurate description using only the initial position, and we are still working on exploiting its potential to understand the dynamics of floating objects in the ocean.</p>

<p>From the data from the first deployment, we could distinguish two different regimes (see <strong>?@fig-pair-dispersion</strong>). However, the separation between them was not clear on the pair diffusivity (<strong>?@fig-pair-diffusivity</strong>). The change of regime arrives at aptoximately two weeks after the deployment, when the distance between pairs is around 70 km. <a href="#fig-seashot-pair-disp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> shows the position of the ship, the drifters and the cyclogesotrophic current from the release until this moment. In the panel (a) we can see the seashot corresponding to the first deployment. We can observe that the distance <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is of the order of the eddies, but not yet the biggest eddies present in the flow. It makes sense that, in this case, the dynamics is still local but changes from a regime where they have been in the same eddy to an intermediate one. At the moment of the writing, five months after the release, he system did not reach yet the diffusive regime.</p>
<p>Regarding the third deployment, we can interpret the results shown in the previous section by looking at <a href="#fig-seashot-pair-disp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. Two weeks after the deployment, the drifters move still all together and the distance they travelled is much smaller than the eddies present in the flow. It is expected, in this case, that the system remains in a local regime for longer. Our observations are in agreement with the previous results from the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="van2015pairwise">[@van2015pairwise]</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="rohrs2023surface">[@rohrs2023surface]</span>, including the specific two week interval before the transition between regimes in the North Sea <span class="citation" data-cites="meyerjurgens2020relative">[@meyerjurgens2020relative]</span>.</p>
